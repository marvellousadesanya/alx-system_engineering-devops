Issue Summary:
Duration: 2 hours from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM EST
Impact: User authentication service was down, users were unable to login or create new accounts, affecting 70% of our user base.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was an incorrect configuration of the load balancer.
Timeline:
12:00 PM EST: Issue was detected by monitoring alerts showing an increase in error rates for user authentication requests.
12:05 PM EST: The engineering team was alerted and started investigating the issue.
12:10 PM EST: Initial assumption was that there was a problem with the database as the error messages suggested a connection issue.
12:20 PM EST: Investigation of the database revealed that there were no issues with the database, and attention was turned towards the load balancer.
12:30 PM EST: After investigating the load balancer configuration, it was discovered that it was misconfigured, leading to the failure of the user authentication service.
12:45 PM EST: The engineering team started working on correcting the load balancer configuration.
1:30 PM EST: The corrected load balancer configuration was deployed to the production environment.
1:45 PM EST: The team confirmed that the user authentication service was functioning correctly.
2:00 PM EST: The issue was officially declared resolved.
Misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken:
Initially, the engineering team believed that the issue was with the database. This led to a wasted effort in investigating the database when the root cause was actually the misconfigured load balancer.
Escalation:
The incident was escalated to the senior engineering team, who were responsible for resolving the issue.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was the misconfigured load balancer, which was sending requests to the wrong backend server. The configuration was corrected, and the load balancer was redeployed to the production environment.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, the following measures will be taken:
Regular audits of load balancer configurations to ensure they are correctly configured.
Improved monitoring of load balancer error rates to detect issues more quickly.
Improved communication between teams to ensure that all members are aware of any changes made to the system.
Implement an automated testing environment for load balancer configurations to catch any misconfigurations before they are deployed to the production environment.
Tasks to address the issue:
Conduct a review of all load balancer configurations to ensure that they are correctly configured.
Update monitoring alerts to include error rates for load balancer requests.
Conduct regular load balancer configuration testing in a staging environment to catch misconfigurations before they are deployed to production.
